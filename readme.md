# Horiseon Refactor Challenge
---
## Description

In this assignment, I added HTML semantics and refactored the CSS file to be more concise and clean. 

- The primary goal for this project was to edit the existing page "Horiseon" to improve its accessibility and overall structure.
- Learning to refactor and organize files was the motivation in pursuing this project.
- This assignment has taught me the basics of concision and organization of HTML and CSS, as well as familiarizing me with jumplinks. Additionally, I learned the difference between divs and sections.
